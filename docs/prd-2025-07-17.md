## Questions for Further Clarification

1. **Natural Language Parsing**: What specific date formats and phrases should we prioritize for parsing? (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 2 weeks")

2. **Terminal UI**: What specific terminal UI interactions do you envision? Should it support the full drag-and-drop workflow or focus on keyboard-driven commands?

3. **Project Organization**: Should projects have their own metadata (status, due dates, descriptions) or remain simple labels?

4. **Animation Preferences**: Are there specific types of animations you want to avoid? Any reference apps whose animations you particularly like or dislike?

5. **Data Migration**: Do you need to import your existing Notion data, and if so, what format would that data be in?

6. **Task Metadata Priority**: Looking at your current setup, which metadata fields are most important to display prominently vs. which can be secondary?

7. **Section Behavior**: Should there be any limits on how many tasks can be in each section, or any automatic behaviors when sections get too full?

8. **Markdown Scope**: What level of markdown complexity should we support? Should we include advanced features like tables, images, or keep it focused on basic formatting?

9. **Task Detail Navigation**: Should there be next/previous navigation within the task detail view to move between tasks without returning to the list?

10. **Multiple URLs**: How should multiple URLs per task be displayed and managed? Should they be listed vertically, or have some other organization method?

11. **Search Performance**: What's the expected maximum number of tasks per user? This will help determine if we need server-side search or if client-side search will suffice.

12. **Filter Persistence**: Should filter states persist across app sessions, or reset each time the user opens the app?

13. **Keyboard Shortcut Customization**: Should users be able to customize keyboard shortcuts, or should we stick with a standard set?

14. **Mobile Gesture Sensitivity**: What level of gesture customization should we provide for different user preferences and accessibility needs?

15. **Section Order**: Should the order of sections (Now, Next, Soon, Someday) be configurable, or should it remain fixed?
