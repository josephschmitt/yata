# Yata - Complete Implementation Guide

## Instructions for the Implementer

This document contains the complete technical specification and step-by-step implementation plan for the Yata application. It is the **single source of truth** for you to build the project.

**Your workflow MUST be as follows:**

1.  **Follow the Tasks Sequentially:** Implement the project by following the phases and numbered task sections in order.
2.  **Mark Progress:** As you complete each individual checklist item `[ ]`, change it to `[x]` in this file.
3.  **Commit After Each Numbered Section:** After you complete all tasks within a numbered section (e.g., after finishing all of section "2.1. Monorepo Setup"), you must:
    a. Save the changes to this file, reflecting the newly checked-off tasks.
    b. Create a Git commit containing all the code you've written for that section **and** the updated version of this task file.
    c. **IMPORTANT:** Before committing, present the `git commit` message and the changes to me for approval. **WAIT for my approval before proceeding.**

Let's begin.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

Yata is a multi-platform application built using a modern TypeScript-first technology stack. The entire project is managed as a **monorepo** using **Bun workspaces**, ensuring code sharing and consistency. The architecture is designed around a central API backend with multiple frontend clients (Web, Mobile, TUI), all syncing data through a robust offline-first mechanism.

### 1.1. Technology Stack

| **CI/CD** | **GitHub Actions** | For automating linting, testing, building, and deployment workflows. |

### 1.2. Data Flow & Sync

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: The Supabase (PostgreSQL) database is the single source of truth.
2.  **API Layer**: The `api` app is the sole intermediary between clients and the database.
3.  **Offline-First Clients**: The `web` and `mobile` apps use **WatermelonDB** to maintain a local copy of data. The UI reads from this local DB, making it instantly responsive and fully functional offline.
4.  **Synchronization**: A custom sync engine communicates with a dedicated `/sync` endpoint on the API to push local changes and pull remote changes.

## 2. Phase 1: Project Foundation & Backend API

### 2.1. Monorepo Setup
- [x] Initialize a Git repository in the project root.
- [x] Create a root `package.json` file using `bun init`.
- [x] Modify the root `package.json` to define Bun workspaces:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "yata",
    "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
  }
  ```
- [x] Create the main directories: `mkdir -p apps packages .github/workflows`.
- [x] Create a `.gitignore` file in the root with standard ignores for `node_modules`, `.env`, build artifacts, and IDE folders.

### 2.2. Shared Configurations
- [x] Create `packages/eslint-config-custom/index.js` for a shared ESLint configuration.
- [x] Create `packages/tsconfig-custom/base.json` for a shared TypeScript configuration with strict settings (`"strict": true`, `"noImplicitAny": true`).
- [x] Create a root `tsconfig.base.json` that references the custom one.

### 2.3. Database Setup (Prisma)
- [x] Create the database package directory: `mkdir packages/db`.
- [x] Initialize a `package.json` inside `packages/db` and add Prisma as a dependency.
- [x] Initialize Prisma: `bunx prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql`.
- [x] **Action Item:** Manually create a new project in **Supabase**, navigate to the database settings, and copy the connection string.
- [x] Update `packages/db/.env` with the Supabase connection string.
- [x] Replace the content of `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` with the schema below.
- [x] Run the first database migration: `bunx prisma migrate dev --name "initial_schema"`.
- [x] Add a script to `packages/db/package.json` for generating the client: `"db:generate": "prisma generate"`.

**Prisma Schema (`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`):**
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  tasks     Task[]
  @@unique([userId, name])
}
```

### 2.4. Backend API (Hono)
- [x] Create and initialize the `apps/api` package.
- [x] Add Hono dependencies: `bun add hono zod @hono/zod-validator`.
- [x] Create `apps/api/src/index.ts` with a basic Hono server.
- [x] Add a `dev` script to `apps/api/package.json`: `"dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts"`.
- [x] Implement the API endpoints as defined below. All endpoints are under the `/api/v1` base path.
- [x] **`/sync` Endpoint:** Implement the `POST /sync` endpoint. This is the most critical part. It must:
    - Accept a request body: `{ "lastPulledAt": "...", "changes": { "tasks": { "created": [...], "updated": [...], "deleted": [...] } } }`
    - Process incoming `changes` by creating, updating, or deleting records in the database using Prisma.
    - Query the database for all records updated since `lastPulledAt`.
    - Respond with server changes: `{ "changes": { "tasks": { "created": [...], "updated": [...] } } }`
- [x] **CRUD Endpoints:** Implement standard CRUD endpoints for `tasks`, `projects`, and `types` (e.g., `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`, etc.).
- [x] **Reorder Endpoint:** Implement `POST /tasks/reorder` to batch update task `section` and `order` from a request body like `[{ "id": "...", "section": "Now", "order": 1.5 }]`.

## 3. Phase 2: Core Logic & Web Application

### 3.1. Core Package (`packages/core`)
- [x] Create and initialize the `packages/core` package.
- [x] Add Zod and WatermelonDB dependencies.
- [x] In `packages/core/src/validation.ts`, define Zod schemas that match the Prisma models for client-side validation.
- [x] In `packages/core/src/db/schema.ts`, define the WatermelonDB schema, mirroring the Prisma schema.
- [x] In `packages/core/src/db/models/`, define a WatermelonDB model file for each table (e.g., `Task.js`).

### 3.2. NLP Package (`packages/nlp`)
- [ ] Create and initialize the `packages/nlp` package.
- [ ] Add `chrono-node` dependency.
- [ ] In `packages/nlp/src/index.ts`, create a `parseTask(input: string)` function.
- [ ] The `parseTask` function should use regex and `chrono-node` to parse the following from the input string:
    - [ ] Task `title` (the remaining text after parsing).
    - [ ] `project` using the `@` symbol (e.g., `@website`).
    - [ ] `type` using the `#` symbol (e.g., `#bug`).
    - [ ] `dueDate` and `whenDate` using natural language (e.g., "due tomorrow", "when Friday").
    - [ ] `urls` by detecting any URLs in the text.
- [ ] The function should return a structured object: `{ title: string, project?: string, type?: string, dueDate?: Date, whenDate?: Date, urls?: string[] }`.

### 3.3. Web App Setup (`apps/web`)
- [ ] Create the web app using `bun create vite apps/web -- --template react-ts`.
- [ ] Add dependencies: `zustand`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `framer-motion`, `dnd-kit`, `tailwindcss`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-react`, `@supabase/supabase-js` and local packages (`@yata/core`, `@yata/nlp`).
- [ ] Initialize and configure Tailwind CSS for Vite.
- [ ] In `main.tsx`, set up the WatermelonDB `LokiJSAdapter` and provide the database instance to the app via a React Context.
- [ ] In `main.tsx`, wrap the application with the Supabase client provider to handle user authentication state.

### 3.4. Web App UI - Layout & Core Components
- [ ] Structure the `src` directory with `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `lib`, `contexts`.
- [ ] Create the `TaskBoard.tsx` page, which will hold the main layout with four columns: "Now", "Next", "Soon", "Someday".
- [ ] The `TaskBoard.tsx` should also render a visually distinct "Waiting" section for blocked tasks.
- [ ] Create the `TaskSection.tsx` component to render a column and its tasks.
- [ ] Create the `TaskCard.tsx` component with the following details based on the PRD's newspaper-style design:
    - [ ] Display a checkbox, monochrome type icon, and task title (using a Serif font).
    - [ ] Below the title, display metadata in a smaller sans-serif font (Project, Due/When Date).
    - [ ] Implement task status visualization via the checkbox: Empty for "todo", a horizontal line for "in_progress", and checked for "done".
    - [ ] Add visual indicators for tasks with subtasks or dependencies.
- [ ] Implement the `QuickEntryInput.tsx` component, using the `@yata/nlp` package.
    - [ ] It should provide a real-time preview of the parsed attributes as the user types.
    - [ ] New tasks created this way should default to the "Someday" section.

### 3.5. Web App UI - Drag & Drop
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality for tasks between and within sections using `dnd-kit`.
- [ ] Ensure smooth, 60fps animations for all drag operations using `Framer Motion`.
- [ ] Provide clear visual feedback during drag operations:
    - [ ] Show a semi-transparent preview of the task being dragged.
    - [ ] Highlight valid drop zones/sections.
    - [ ] Show an insertion line to indicate where the task will be placed.
- [ ] Implement auto-scrolling when dragging a task near the top or bottom of a section.
- [ ] Add logic so that when a task is dropped into the "Now" section, its status automatically changes to "in_progress".

### 3.6. Web App UI - Task Detail View
- [ ] Implement the `TaskDetailView.tsx` as a modal or a separate page that opens with a smooth transition when a task is clicked.
- [ ] Design the view to match the PRD (Things/Todoist-inspired):
    - [ ] A larger version of the task's title row (checkbox, title in serif font).
    - [ ] A section for all editable task attributes (Project, Type, Dates, URLs, etc.).
    - [ ] A horizontal divider and a free-form content area below it.
- [ ] Implement interactive attribute editing:
    - [ ] Tapping the checkbox cycles through task statuses.
    - [ ] Tapping date fields opens a native date picker.
    - [ ] Project and Type fields should have autocomplete from existing values.
    - [ ] URL fields should allow editing the URL text, and have a separate icon to open the link in a new tab.
- [ ] Implement a markdown editor for the content area with real-time preview, supporting standard markdown and checklists (`- [ ]`).
- [ ] Add UI for managing subtasks and dependencies (viewing, adding, removing).

### 3.7. Web App UI - Search & Filtering
- [ ] Implement a global search bar component.
- [ ] Implement client-side search logic that queries the local WatermelonDB database across task titles, content, and metadata.
- [ ] Search results should show in real-time, highlighting the search term.
- [ ] Implement section-specific filter controls (by project, type, due date).
- [ ] Implement support for advanced search operators in the global search bar (e.g., `@project`, `#type`, `due:today`, `status:waiting`).

### 3.8. Web App UI - Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Implement the comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for task movement and navigation as specified in the PRD.
    - [ ] `Arrow keys` to select tasks.
    - [ ] `Ctrl/Cmd + Arrows` to move tasks within/between sections.
    - [ ] `Ctrl/Cmd + 1/2/3/4` to move task to a specific section.
    - [ ] `Enter` to open detail view, `Escape` to close.
    - [ ] `Ctrl/Cmd + /` to focus global search.
    - [ ] `Ctrl/Cmd + K` to focus quick entry input.

### 3.9. Web App UI - Authentication
- [ ] Create Login and Signup pages/modals that use the Supabase client.
- [ ] Implement protected routes that require a user to be logged in to view the task board.
- [ ] Add a logout button.

## 4. Phase 3: Testing & Deployment

### 4.1. Testing
- [ ] Add `vitest` to the monorepo root and configure it for all workspaces.
- [ ] Add `React Testing Library` to the web app.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the `nlp` package and `core` validation logic.
- [ ] Write component tests for `TaskCard`, `TaskSection`, and `TaskDetailView`.
- [ ] Add `Playwright` for E2E testing.
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical user flows:
    - [ ] User signup and login.
    - [ ] Creating a task via quick entry with NLP.
    - [ ] Dragging a task between sections.
    - [ ] Searching for a task and filtering results.
    - [ ] Moving a task using keyboard shortcuts.
    - [ ] Offline editing and successful synchronization.

### 4.2. CI/CD
- [ ] Create `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- [ ] Configure the workflow to trigger on push/PR to `main`.
- [ ] Add jobs for:
    1.  **Lint & Type-Check**: Run ESLint and `tsc --noEmit`.
    2.  **Test**: Run `vitest run`.
    3.  **Build**: Run `bun run build` for `web` and `api`.

### 4.3. Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create a multi-stage `Dockerfile` in `apps/api` using `oven/bun` for an optimized production image.
- [ ] Ensure the `apps/web` build output is a standard static directory (`dist`).
- [ ] Create `.env.example` files in each app that requires environment variables.

## 5. Phase 4: Final Polish and Documentation

### 5.1. Accessibility (a11y)
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable with clear focus states.
- [ ] Use semantic HTML and add appropriate ARIA attributes, especially for the drag-and-drop implementation to announce source, destination, and instructions to screen readers.
- [ ] Check for sufficient color contrast in the monochrome design.

### 5.2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Use `React.lazy()` to code-split the `TaskDetailView`.
- [ ] Use `React.memo` on `TaskCard` to prevent unnecessary re-renders during drag operations.

### 5.3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement configurable Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits for the "Now" section, with visual warnings when the limit is approached or exceeded.
- [ ] Implement the logic for automatic task promotion (Someday → Soon → Next) based on `whenDate` or `dueDate`. This can be a function that runs when the app loads.
- [ ] Create a settings page/modal where users can:
    - [ ] Manage custom task types (add, edit, delete with icon).
    - [ ] Configure WIP limits and auto-promotion rules.

### 5.4. Project Documentation
- [ ] Create a `README.md` file in the project root.
- [ ] The README should include a project description, tech stack list, and clear setup instructions for developers (clone, `bun install`, `bun run dev`).

---

## 6. Phase 5: Universal UI & Component Migration

This phase focuses on creating a shared UI library with Tamagui to allow components to be used across both the Web and Mobile applications, as specified in the tech spec.

### 6.1. UI Package Setup (`packages/ui`)
- [ ] Create and initialize the `packages/ui` package.
- [ ] Add Tamagui, React, and React Native dependencies: `bun add tamagui @tamagui/config react react-dom react-native react-native-web`.
- [ ] Create a basic Tamagui configuration file (`tamagui.config.ts`) in the package root.
- [ ] Set up the package to build for both web and native platforms.

### 6.2. Create Universal Components
- [ ] Create basic, universal components specified in the tech spec:
    - `packages/ui/src/Button.tsx`
    - `packages/ui/src/Input.tsx`
    - `packages/ui/src/Checkbox.tsx`
    - `packages/ui/src/Typography.tsx` (with `Serif` and `SansSerif` variants)
- [ ] Ensure these components are exported from the package's main entry point.

### 6.3. Migrate Web Components to Universal
- [ ] Move the `TaskCard.tsx` component from `apps/web/src/components` to `packages/ui/src/TaskCard.tsx`.
- [ ] Refactor `TaskCard.tsx` using Tamagui components (`YStack`, `XStack`, `Text`, etc.) so it can render on both web and native. Ensure it continues to support all visual states (status, dependencies, subtasks).
- [ ] Move `TaskSection.tsx` and `TaskBoard.tsx` to `packages/ui` and refactor them to be universal.
- [ ] Update the `apps/web` application to remove its local versions of these components and import them from `@yata/ui` instead.
- [ ] Verify that the web application still looks and functions as it did before the migration.

---

## 7. Phase 6: Mobile Application (React Native)

This phase involves building the native mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native, reusing the core logic and UI components already developed.

### 7.1. Mobile App Setup (`apps/mobile`)
- [ ] Initialize a new React Native project in `apps/mobile`. Use the command: `npx react-native init yata-mobile --directory apps/mobile`.
- [ ] Add local monorepo dependencies: `@yata/core`, `@yata/ui`.
- [ ] Add other required dependencies like WatermelonDB and its native adapters: `@nozbe/watermelondb`, `@nozbe/with-observables`.
- [ ] Link native dependencies: `cd apps/mobile && pod install`.
- [ ] Configure WatermelonDB for React Native, setting up the native SQLite adapter. This involves native code changes in `MainActivity.java` (Android) and `AppDelegate.mm` (iOS).

### 7.2. Mobile UI and Sync Implementation
- [ ] In `apps/mobile/App.tsx`, set up the WatermelonDB provider, similar to the web app.
- [ ] Implement the main application UI using components from `@yata/ui`.
    - [ ] Use `TaskBoard.tsx` as the main screen.
- [ ] Implement mobile-specific navigation (e.g., using React Navigation) to handle views like the `TaskDetailView`.
- [ ] Implement intuitive touch gestures for task management as specified in the PRD:
    - [ ] **Tap and hold** on a task to open a contextual movement menu.
    - [ ] **Swipe left/right** on a task to move it to the previous/next section.
    - [ ] **Long press + drag** to initiate drag-and-drop.
    - [ ] **Double tap** to open the `TaskDetailView`.
    - [ ] Provide haptic feedback for all gesture interactions.
- [ ] Connect the client-side sync logic from `@yata/core` to the API, ensuring offline capabilities work correctly on a mobile device.
- [ ] Test the application on both iOS Simulator and an Android Emulator.

---

## 8. Phase 7: Terminal UI (TUI)

This phase covers the implementation of the command-line interface using Ink, providing a fast, keyboard-driven way to interact with Yata.

### 8.1. TUI App Setup (`apps/tui`)
- [ ] Create and initialize the `apps/tui` package.
- [ ] Add Ink and React dependencies: `bun add ink react`.
- [ ] Add any required Ink community component packages, such as `ink-text-input` or `ink-select-input`.
- [ ] Create the main entry file `apps/tui/src/cli.tsx`.
- [ ] Add a `bin` field to `apps/tui/package.json` to make the CLI executable (e.g., `"bin": "./src/cli.tsx"`).
- [ ] Add a `dev` script to run the TUI in development: `"dev": "bun --watch src/cli.tsx"`.

### 8.2. TUI Implementation
- [ ] In `cli.tsx`, create the main Ink component for the TUI. This will serve as the entry point.
- [ ] Implement a simple API client (using `fetch`) to communicate directly with the backend API. The TUI does not need offline sync.
- [ ] Use TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) to manage fetching, caching, and refetching data from the API.
- [ ] Design the layout using Ink's primitive components (`<Box>`, `<Text>`) to display tasks grouped by section ("Now", "Next", etc.). The layout should be built using Flexbox, consistent with the web app.
- [ ] Build custom, reusable components for the TUI, such as `<TaskCard>` and `<TaskSection>`, using Ink's primitives.
- [ ] Implement the specific keyboard controls from the PRD using Ink's `useInput` hook:
    - [ ] `j/k` for selection, `h/l` to move between sections.
    - [ ] `J/K` to move task within section, `H/L` to move task between sections.
    - [ ] `1/2/3/4` to move task to a specific section.
    - [ ] `i` to insert (using `ink-text-input`), `e` to edit, `enter` for details, `/` for search.
- [ ] Implement functionality to view task details, add new tasks, and change a task's status/section via keyboard commands.
- [ ] Add support for command-line arguments (e.g., using `yargs` or `mri`) to allow for quick task creation like `yata-tui add "New task for @Project #Type"`.
- [ ] Ensure the TUI is ready to be published to NPM as a package.
